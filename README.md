# What it is?
login menu for an iOS app.

#How does it work?
The first view has two TextFields to enter the username and password fields. Also, it has a button that checks that the TextFields are not empty and sends the user to the second view.

The second view receives the data from the TextFields of the first and shows them to know which is the user and the password entered by the user.
